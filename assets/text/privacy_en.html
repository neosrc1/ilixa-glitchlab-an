<h3>Ilixa Privacy Policy</h3>

<h4>Summary</h4>
Ilixa apps may collect data on how the user interacts with an app. <br>
This is never a necessity. You have the option to opt-out of this data collection in the app's settings.<br>
The collected data is anonymous and used to see how the apps are used in order to improve them. The collected data is not shared with any third parties except for the company that provide the analytics software, in this case Google. Here is Google's statement on this sharing of data with them:<br>
<blockquote>Data you collect, process, and store using Google Analytics ("Google Analytics data") is secure and kept confidential. This data is used to maintain and protect the Google Analytics service, to perform system critical operations, and in rare exceptions for legal reasons as described in our privacy policy.</blockquote>
